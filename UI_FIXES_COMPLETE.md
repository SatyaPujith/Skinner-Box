# UI Fixes Complete ✅

## Changes Made:

### 1. ✅ Restored Original Learning Quest UI
- Reverted to the original big, colorful design
- Large centered input field with placeholder text
- Big "BEGIN QUEST" button with Creepster font
- Kept the dramatic horror theme

### 2. ✅ Updated Main Dashboard UI
- **"New Burial" section** now matches Learning Quest theme:
  - Dark background with red borders
  - Skull icon with "BURY A NEW SOUL" title in Creepster font
  - Styled input fields matching the quest theme
  - Red "BURY FOREVER" button
  
- **"Graveyard" section** also updated:
  - Matching dark background and red borders
  - Skull icon with "THE GRAVEYARD" title
  - Consistent styling throughout

### 3. ✅ Fixed Arrow Button Behavior
- **Before**: Clicking arrow opened horror block INSIDE the extension popup
- **After**: Clicking arrow opens horror block in a NEW CHROME TAB
- This prevents the cramped view and gives full screen experience
- Works properly whether in popup or full page view

## How It Works Now:

1. **Open Extension Popup** → See the new themed dashboard
2. **Add a site** → Use the styled "BURY A NEW SOUL" section
3. **Click arrow button** on buried site → Opens horror block in NEW TAB
4. **Complete quest** → Site opens and is removed from graveyard

## Visual Consistency:

All screens now share the same theme:
- Dark backgrounds (#0a0a0a, rgba(0,0,0,0.7))
- Red accents (#DC2626, #7F1D1D)
- Creepster font for titles
- Consistent borders and shadows
- Matching button styles

The extension now has a cohesive, professional horror aesthetic throughout!
