# SkinnerBox Usage Guide

## Overview

SkinnerBox is a Chrome extension that uses horror-themed psychological deterrents to help you break digital addictions. Unlike simple blockers, it makes accessing blocked sites genuinely unpleasant.

## Core Concept

1. **Bury** websites you want to avoid for a set number of days
2. **Blocked** automatically when you try to visit them
3. **Penance** required (1 hour of horror) if you need emergency access
4. **Temporary unlock** for 10 minutes after completing penance

## How to Bury a Website

1. Click the SkinnerBox extension icon in Chrome
2. In the "NEW_BURIAL_PROTOCOL" section:
   - Enter the website domain (e.g., `facebook.com`, `twitter.com`, `reddit.com`)
   - Use the slider to choose burial duration (1-365 days)
3. Click "Bury Website"
4. Watch the burial ritual animation
5. Click the card to seal it in the coffin

## What Happens When You Try to Visit

When you try to visit a buried website:

1. **Instant Redirect**: Chrome immediately redirects you to a horror block page
2. **Horror Animations**: Full-screen horror GIFs and animations play
3. **Two Options**:
   - **"I remain strong"**: Close the page and stay committed
   - **"Challenge the Void"**: Start the 1-hour penance ritual

## The Penance Ritual

If you choose to challenge the void:

1. **1 Hour Timer**: You must watch for exactly 1 hour
2. **Horror Media**: Rotating horror animations from various sources
3. **No Escape**: Closing the window resets the timer
4. **Creepy Messages**: Random disturbing messages appear
5. **Progress Bar**: Shows how much time remains

After completing the full hour:
- You get **10 minutes** of access to the site
- After 10 minutes, it's blocked again
- You'll need another hour of penance for more access

## Tips for Success

### Choosing What to Bury
- Start with your biggest time-wasters
- Be specific with domains (e.g., `youtube.com` blocks all of YouTube)
- Consider burying mobile app websites too

### Setting Duration
- **1-7 days**: Good for short-term focus (exam week, project deadline)
- **30 days**: Break a habit loop
- **90+ days**: Serious addiction recovery

### Staying Strong
- The horror animations are intentionally disturbing
- The 1-hour penance is designed to be genuinely unpleasant
- Most people give up rather than complete it
- That's the point - it makes you reconsider if you really need access

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Sites
- You can bury multiple websites simultaneously
- Each has its own timer and burial period
- All are tracked in the "GRAVEYARD_MANIFEST" section

### Attempt Tracking
- The extension counts how many times you try to visit buried sites
- Shows as "FAILED ATTEMPTS" in red text
- Helps you see your struggle patterns

### Permanent Removal
- Sites automatically "unseal" when the burial period expires
- You'll get a notification asking if you want to resurrect it
- Choose to either allow access again or re-bury it

## Common Scenarios

### "I need to check one thing quickly"
- This is addiction talking
- The 1-hour penance is designed to make you question this
- Ask yourself: Is it worth an hour of horror?

### "What if there's an emergency?"
- Real emergencies don't happen on social media
- Use your phone or ask someone else to check
- The penance option exists for true emergencies

### "I'll just use incognito mode"
- The extension works in incognito if you enable it
- Go to `chrome://extensions/` → SkinnerBox → "Allow in incognito"

### "I'll just use another browser"
- That's a choice you have to make
- Consider installing similar blockers there too
- Or accept that you're not ready to change

## Psychology Behind It

SkinnerBox uses several psychological principles:

1. **Friction**: Makes bad habits harder to execute
2. **Aversion**: Associates blocked sites with unpleasant experiences
3. **Time Cost**: Makes you pay with time, your most valuable resource
4. **Commitment**: The burial ritual creates psychological commitment
5. **Visibility**: Seeing failed attempts creates awareness

## Troubleshooting

**"The horror animations aren't loading"**
- Check your internet connection
- Some networks block Giphy (the source of animations)
- The extension will still block, just without animations

**"I found a way around it"**
- That's your choice
- The extension is a tool, not a prison
- If you're actively trying to bypass it, you're not ready to change

**"The timer reset when I closed the window"**
- This is intentional
- You must complete the full hour without closing
- No shortcuts

**"Can I reduce the penance time?"**
- No, it's hardcoded to 1 hour
- This is by design
- If you want to modify it, you'll need to edit the source code

## Philosophy

SkinnerBox isn't about perfect blocking. It's about making you conscious of your choices. Every time you see the horror screen, you're forced to decide: Is this worth it?

The 1-hour penance isn't meant to be completed. It's meant to be so unpleasant that you choose not to access the site at all.

If you find yourself regularly completing the penance, the extension isn't working for you. Consider:
- Longer burial periods
- Burying more sites
- Seeking additional support for digital addiction
- Addressing underlying issues driving the behavior

## Support

This is an open-source project. If you have issues or suggestions:
- Check the GitHub repository
- Read the installation guide
- Review the source code
- Modify it to suit your needs

Remember: The extension is a tool. Your commitment is what matters.
