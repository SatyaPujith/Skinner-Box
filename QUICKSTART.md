# Quick Start Guide

## 1. Build the Extension

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## 2. Load into Chrome

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right toggle)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `dist` folder

## 3. Start Blocking

1. Click the extension icon
2. Enter a website (e.g., `youtube.com`)
3. Choose days to block (1-365)
4. Click "Bury Website"
5. Done! That site is now blocked.

## 4. What Happens Next

- Try visiting the blocked site → Horror screen appears
- Want access? → Watch 1 hour of horror animations
- Complete the hour → Get 10 minutes of access
- After 10 minutes → Blocked again

## Example Sites to Block

- `youtube.com` - Video addiction
- `instagram.com` - Social media
- `twitter.com` / `x.com` - News/social
- `reddit.com` - Forum browsing
- `facebook.com` - Social media
- `tiktok.com` - Short videos
- `netflix.com` - Streaming
- `twitch.tv` - Live streams

## Tips

- Use just the domain name (no `www.` or `https://`)
- Start with 7-30 days for your first burial
- The horror animations are intentionally disturbing
- The 1-hour penance is meant to deter you, not be completed
- You can bury multiple sites at once
